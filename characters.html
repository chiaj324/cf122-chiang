	<h3>
		THE GIRL
	</h3>
	<p class="right">
		every conversation is a dead thing she tries to pick them up and turn them over but they seem to be stapled to the ground half of her walk is spent looking sideways she loves to walk even if maybe she's not going anywhere she wants but she'll never say things tend to leave when she says how much she wants them it's a shame that she's so flighty she would've made an excellent housewife she looks for satisfaction but ends up with water up to her calves in the shallow end there is a rhythm and her stomach falls on the offbeats sometimes she'll sit in the tub and wonder about easier things
	</p>
	<h3>
		THE QUIET
	</h3>
	<p class="left">
		it's nothing sinister but it sometimes wishes it was it is so much easier to exist with a goal but at least it never loses it just keeps things the way they are even when change is necessary there is a part of its limbs that lies down on hardwood floors and waits for scraps but mostly it takes and takes and takes there are things that never get full it carries itself with confidence but looks like it never has enough to eat don't you just wish that you were sleeping in your childhood home forever where you could hear the crickets at night and the finches when the sun rises if only you knew what you wanted it would be kinder but you don't and it isn't
	</p>
	<h3>
		THE METHOD
	</h3>
	<p class="right">
		it loves to peel caps off of bottles with long fingernails and overhear conversation that it knows will hurt to listen to half the shit it says is just dead noise but it doesn't even talk enough to be heard thank god no one knows what it's saying it just holds out until christmas everything will be so much prettier in the snow but it worries that it'll all be the same because it is running out of things to look forward to so it blames itself and never says a word about it brain stuff is private no one needs to know
